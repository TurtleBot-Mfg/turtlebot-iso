Requires Ubuntu Customization Kit 2.4.7-0ubuntu1

Building the ISO
--------------------------------
./build
  or
sudo uck-remaster ~/Downloads/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso ~/turtlebot-iso

Config Files
--------------------------------
apt_packages	List of packages to install via apt
apt_deinstall	Packages to remove from the default Ubuntu ISO
deb_packages	Packages that are not in a public repo [for testing]
pip_packages	Python packages installed via pip
inst_packages	Packages only needed for installer
patch_list	ISO patches [if all else fails]

OEM Install
--------------------------------
To prevent the system from being installed with a default password,
hold down the left shift key when grub starts and press F4 to select
'OEM Mode' and select 'Install Ubuntu'. After the machine reboots,
oem-config-prepare or the OEM setup desktop icon must be run to make
the machine ready for the enduser.

Getting it to install from PXE boot is left as an exercise for the
vendor. Patches are appreciated.

Notes and Known Bugs
--------------------------------
UEFI sucks and SecureBoot is designed to allow companies to control
what is installed on your computer. Demand hardware without it.
Newer machines may require UEFI, so you may or may not need to boot the
system in UEFI mode. 32-bit machines do not work with UEFI.

Installing with wireless enabled seems to work slightly better.
Otherwise you may need to run the following when the system is online.
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo agt-get dist-upgrade

If wireless access points do not show up, try disabling and reenabling
the wireless network connection.
